# Task-Manager
It's useful CLI task manager, but only a little bit :)  

# New updates  
1) Appended -M to move to non-existent task lists  
2) Appended -K to delete usable task list  
3) Changed some macroses to correct work the -K  
4) Changed install.sh, it don't make the first task list  
5) You can close your task list by -q  
6) Appended "make release" command to get release version
  
# Plans  
1) Append configure file  
2) Refactoring   
3) Append -s to print from other task list(like "tasks -s "list2")
